# multi-area-ospf
This Packet Tracer lab simulates an enterprise network using multi-area OSPF routing, with external customer networks connected via static routes. Static routes from customer edge routers are redistributed into OSPF by the core routers, enabling full end-to-end IP connectivity between internal departments and external zones.
